# The SANSND plugin for  NCrystal

This repository contains code for the NCrystal plugin named `SANSND`, which implement Small Angles Neutron Scattering for NanoDiamonds.

This plugin is mainly based on the work of Jos√© Ignacio Marquez Damian, Monte Carlo Simulation Scientist at ESS Spallation Physics, who implemented Nanodiamond support in MCNP and PHITS.

**It is currently under development and not ready for general usage**

The simple model implemented here has its basis in the SANS structure factor measured by [Teshigawara et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2019.03.038) and combines it with a scattering kernel for bulk diamond computed from DFT as explained by [Granada et al.](https://doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/202023104002). The structure factor in the Teshigawara paper is fitted by a power-exponential law, which is then further simplified into a piecewise power fit.
